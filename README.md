Setup Spider
============

This is a set of scripts used to install programs that i normally install on
the computer. This is a set of scripts used to install the programs
automatically for yum or apt based systems. This was primarily written for
fedora but i am including some raspberry pi apt scripts.

It can be configured to use any other setup based scripts where a list of
packages need to be installed.

It also is configured so that you can update the system by just calling update.
