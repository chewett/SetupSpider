Setup Spider
============

TODO: update this

This is a set of scripts used to install programs that i normally install on
the computer. This is a set of scripts used to install the programs
automatically for yum or apt based systems. This was primarily written for
fedora but i am including some raspberry pi apt scripts.

Each branch represents a different version of fedora currently, it might be
better to seperate the different OS types into different git repo's since
currently the only branched OS is fedora. master follows the most current
fedora release, At the moment that is fedora core 22.

It can be configured to use any other setup based scripts where a list of
packages need to be installed.

It also is configured so that you can update the system by just calling update.
